            <h3> Since October 2017 I have worked at Papa Urbs Stockton. I work on average of 20 hours a week year round.
                My job entails tasks such as taking orders, making orders, preparing ingredients, cleaning and opening &
                closing the restaurant. An aspect of my job that I will carry for the rest of my life is the communication
                skills I have aquired through working with large quantites of orders coming in. Being able to communicate
                orders needs to be taken care of as well as orders that are being sent out to customers effiecently while 
                under pressure is a task that after years of practice I feel I have a good grasp on.
